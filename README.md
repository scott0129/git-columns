# git-miller
Github repository explorer that uses miller columns for faster and easier navigation

## Potential FAQ:
### Why can't I see my private repos?
Github's Oauth API doesn't have super fine-grained control over its permissions,
and it doesn't allow you to give me private read permissions without ALSO
handing me the write permissions.

I'll work on converting this to a Github App with much more fine-grained controls
